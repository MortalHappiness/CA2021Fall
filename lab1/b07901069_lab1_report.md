## Modules Explanation

### `Adder.v`

(Same as homework 4)

Adder module reads two 32 bits signed integer as inputs and output the sum of these two integers. This module directly assign the sum of these two integers to output.

### `MUX2.v`

(Same as `MUX32` module in homework 4)

MUX2 module reads two 32 bits data and a select signal as input, and outputs one of these two data based on the select signal. This module directly assigns the output wire with the verilog ternary conditional operator. If the select signal is 1, output data 2. Else output data 1.

### `MUX4.v`

MUX4 module reads four 32 bits data and a 2-bit select signal as input, and outputs one of these four data based on the select signal. This module directly assigns the output wire with the verilog ternary conditional operator. If the select signal is 00, output data 1. If the select signal is 01, output data 2. If the select signale is 10, output data 3. Else output data 4.

### `Sign_Extend.v`

Sign_Extend module reads the 32 bit instruction as input, and outputs its sign-extended 32 bit immediate as output based on the instruction type. It first examines the opcode of the instruction. If the opcode indicates that this instruction is `sw`, then `data_o` will be the concatenation of 20 bits of `funct7[6]` and funct7 and `RDaddr`. If the opcode indicates that this instruction is `beq`, then `data_o` will be the concatenation of 21 bits of `funct7[6]` and `RDaddr[0]` and `funct7[5:0]` and `RDaddr[4:1]`. Otherwise `data_o` will be the concatenation of 20 bits of `funct7[6]` and `funct7` and `RS2addr`.

### `Control.v`

Control module reads 7 bit opcode and 1 bit NoOp signal as input, and outputs 1 bit RegWrite, 1 bit MemtoReg, 1 bit MemRead, 1 bit MemWrite, 2 bit ALUOp, 1 bit ALUSrc and 1 bit Branch signals. If NoOp is 1, then all output signals will be zero. This can be observed from `~NoOp_i &&` in all 1 bit output signals and `(NoOp_i) ? 2'b00` in ALUOp_o assignment. `~NoOp_i &&` statement indicates that if `NoOp_i` is 1, then the output will be the logical-and of 0 and another signal, which is always 0. In `ALUOp_o`, if `NoOp_i` is 1, then `ALUOp_o` will be `2'b00`.

If `NoOp_i` is 0, then this module assigns `RegWrite_o` to 1 if the opcode is not store or branch operation. It assigns `MemtoReg_o` to 1 if the opcode is not R-type or I-type instructions. It assigns `MemRead_o` to 1 if the opcode is `ld`. It assigns `MemWrite_o` to 1 if the opcode is `sd`. It assigns `ALUSrc_o` to 1 if the opcode is not R-type or `beq`. It assigns `Branch_o` to 1 if the opcode is `beq`.

For `ALUOp_o`, it assigns it to `ALU_Control.ALUOP_RType` if the opcode is R-type instruction. It assigns it to `ALU_Control.ALUOP_IType` if the opcode is I-type instruction. It assigns it to `ALU_Control.ALUOp_Subtract` if the opcode is `beq`. Otherwise it assigns `ALUOp_o` to `ALU_Control.ALUOp_Add`.

### `ALU_Control.v`

ALU_Control module reads 10 bit `funct_i` as input, this input is generated by concatenating `funct7` and `funct3`. This module also reads 2 bit ALUOp and outputs 3 bit ALUCtrl signal. This module first separate `funct7` and `funct3` from `funct_i`. Next assign `ALUCtrl_o` based on `ALUOp_i`, `funct7`, and `funct3`.

- If `ALUOp_i` is equal to `ALUOp_Add`, then assign `ALUCtrl_o` with `ALU.ALU_ADD`.

- If `ALUOp_i` is equal to `ALUOp_RType` and `funct7` is equal to `0000000` and `funct3` is equal to `100`, then assign `ALUCtrl_o` with `ALU.ALU_XOR`.
- If `ALUOp_i` is equal to `ALUOp_RType` and `funct7` is equal to `0000000` and `funct3` is equal to `001`, then assign `ALUCtrl_o` with `ALU.ALU_SLL`.
- If `ALUOp_i` is equal to `ALUOp_RType` and `funct7` is equal to `0000000` and `funct3` is equal to `000`, then assign `ALUCtrl_o` with `ALU.ALU_ADD`.
- If `ALUOp_i` is equal to `ALUOp_RType` and `funct7` is equal to `0100000` and `funct3` is equal to `000`, then assign `ALUCtrl_o` with `ALU.ALU_SUB`.
- If `ALUOp_i` is equal to `ALUOp_RType` and `funct7` is equal to `0000001` and `funct3` is equal to `000`, then assign `ALUCtrl_o` with `ALU.ALU_MUL`.
- If `ALUOp_i` is equal to `ALUOp_IType` and `funct3` is equal to `000`, then assign `ALUCtrl_o` with `ALU.ALU_ADD`.
- If `ALUOp_i` is equal to `ALUOp_IType` and `funct7` is equal to `0100000` and `funct3` is equal to `101`, then assign `ALUCtrl_o` with `ALU.ALU_SRA`.

(Same as homework 4)

ALU module reads two 32 bit signed integers and 3 bit ALUCtrl as input, and outputs one 32 bit signed integer and one 1 bit zero signal. This module assigns `data_o` to different output based on `ALUCtrl`. This module assigns `Zero_o` to 1 if `ALUCtrl_i` is equal to `ALU_SUB` and `data1_i` is equal to `data_2_i` else 0.

If `ALUCtrl_i` is equal to `ALU_AND`, then assigns `data_o` with the bitwise and of `data1_i` and `data2_i`.
If `ALUCtrl_i` is equal to `ALU_XOR`, then assigns `data_o` with the bitwise xor of `data1_i` and `data2_i`.
If `ALUCtrl_i` is equal to `ALU_SLL`, then assigns `data_o` with `data1_i` logically left shift by `data2_i` bits.
If `ALUCtrl_i` is equal to `ALU_ADD`, then assigns `data_o` with `data1_i + data2_i`.
If `ALUCtrl_i` is equal to `ALU_SUB`, then assigns `data_o` with `data1_i - data2_i`.
If `ALUCtrl_i` is equal to `ALU_MUL`, then assigns `data_o` with `data1_i * data2_i`.
If `ALUCtrl_i` is equal to `ALU_SRA`, then assigns `data_o` with `data1_i` arithematically right shift by `data2_i[4:0]` bits.

## Difficulties Encountered and Solutions in This Lab

### Difficulty 1

The testcases provided by TA has no `beq` instruction.

### Solution 1

I wrote custom testcases containing `beq` instruction for debuging.

### Difficulty 2

Flush and Stall are hard to debug.

### Solution 2

Use gtkwave to debug and carefully trace each signal and observe the values of pipeline registers.

## Development Environment

My OS is "Linux Mint 20.2 Cinnamon". The compiler is `iverilog` version 10.3. I use VSCode to write this homework.
